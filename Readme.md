## Project Description
An NFT marketplace where artists and creators can come together to buy and sell NFTs.

The project is based on the ERC1155 token standard where we have fungible tokens (silver and gold coins) as payment currencies and non-fungible tokens for collectables.

Authenticating users to the application using Metamask by signing a nonce generated by the backend server, instead of users providing a username and password or social media login.
